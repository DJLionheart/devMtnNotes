//Binding the 'this' keyword

this.function1 = this.function1.bind(this)

//Binding: declaring a new function, binding it to the same name, 
//Binding it to an instance of the class app.


//You don't have to bind if you're only using "this" to set the state. To bind or not to bind... This is indeed the question.


//PROPS
//Props are continuously updated...


//Keys are a way that react keeps track of iteration...
//Like with .map - it basically assigns a name to each one of those divs that is unique.

//Shortcut, which is why it has to be unique... A shortcut for react to keep track of the iterated data.


//STATE - An object where we keep our information. It's organized so we know where to look.
//Look in the same place for our variables.
//Not that special... Besides the fact that it's where we will keep our data.

//Design - you have to think about how the user will try to break the code, and try to prevent that.


//Parents will tell children what to do, but children will never tell parents what to do.
