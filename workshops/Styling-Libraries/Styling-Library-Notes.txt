Sandbox/Playground App - A Place to test out tech and see if it works.

That way I won't have to create a new app every time I want to try something out.



CSS in JS ----
-----------------------------
Great library for group projects. CSS in your javascript files.

You can have merge conflicts if multiple people are updating the same CSS files.

You can just pull up a javascript file and style it in the code, so you don't have to
worry about changes in the CSS files.

Aphrodite
------------------

Just build a styles object

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    button: {
        background: 'blue',
        border: 'none',
        borderRadius: '3px',
        color: this.state.selected ? white : 'blue'
    }
})



<button className={css(styles.button)}>Choose</button>
