//Toy Problem Solving Steps:

//1. Clarify
//2. Sample Data - Figure out how the person might break the code, and how to handle that.
    //What happens if there's a letter?
    //What if I get null? What do I do with that?
    //What if there are negative integers?
    //It's good to think of ten pieces of sample data
//3. Pseudo Code ------------> Write it out in Codelish
    //Before you write down the code, right down some of the data types you need.
    //What does recursive mean?
//4. Solve
