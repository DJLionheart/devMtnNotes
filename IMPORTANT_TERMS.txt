Semantic HTML
Use descriptive tags that have meanings
If it's a section, use section <section className=""></section>
If it's a header, use a header tag <header className=""></header>
If your content is a bunch of divs with no descriptions, it's really hard on the accessibility.

Using descriptive tags that have meaning to help with accessibility.
