FULLSTACK REVIEW - 19 April 2018



Routes:
------------------

Home (login)
path='/'

Private
path='/private'





Users Table
-------------------

ID - Primary Key
USER_NAME - Text
IMG - Text
Auth_ID - Text

(Not varchar, because we're logging in with google, and I'm going to trust that google won't mess up my server).

If it was a more serious app, I would look into the auth id data and put my own checks in place.





For personal projects, get an idea of your component tree.
Depending on how many major components you have will determine what you store on redux.


Where possible, I'm going to hit an endpoint, get the data I need, modify it on the server, and THEN send it to the front-end.
BUT heavy lifting can be done on the front end.

Axios call - refactor the endpoint to do more heavy lifting.
