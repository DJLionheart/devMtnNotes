Unit Testing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group Project Requirements:

5 Unit Tests & 5 Additional Tests per person

(Endpoint, Functional, Etc)



Test units of code to verify it's doing what it's supposed to.

Given a specific input, we should expect a specific output.

No matter how many times I combine the same ingredients, if I follow the same input, I will get the same output.


2 Methods:

1. Write code and then test it.

2. Write a test, and then code.
---------When I write the function, it should do this: .....


Test-Driven Development - TDD

1. Write a test.
2. Run a test (fails because there's no code)
3. Write enough code to make it pass.
4. Code passes test.
5. Refactor (Workable code, but how to improve it?) (As needed to improve)
6. Clean the code

We're developing with other humans.
Someone else on my team goes in and adds a feature... Did it break? The original test developed specifications for what the code has to do.

Behavior-Driven Development(?)


JEST 
---------------------------
JavaScript Testing Library (JavaScript, React Apps, React Native Apps, other JavaScript Frameworks)

Jest is an assertion library. If you can learn/understand Jest, you can understand other 
assertion libraries 


Start Writing Tests:
Stress tests for the wings of an airplane. They're supposed to withstand a specific level of turbulance. A test intended to fail, but it tells engineers how much pressure the wings can take
before they snap off.

Server - Load Testing (You can send fake traffic to your server to see how many requests it can take before it explodes.)
