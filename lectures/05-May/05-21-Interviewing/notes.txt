CSS Box Model -
CSS Mechanic, start with the element - padding, border, and margin.

Margin - white space between elements and others

Border - light grey?

Margins - use in navbar quite a bit.

Padding adds white space between element and border (pushed element away from border)
Padding helps keep elements away from the edge of the page.

Too much padding will make the element bigger.

Margin always makes leemnt bigger.

Margin, padding, border can all be set individually.

Feedback: 

He gave specific examples in how he used the technologies. Noticing trends, things he observed.

////  
1. Technical answer/explanation.
2. Usage examples of when you've used it.
3. Related-topic question.

Finish with a question ('Would you like to know more about ___' - I could share more, but I'm stopping because I recognize I've been talking for a while.) One of the best ways to end.
(If they say yes, that's like feeding your own interview questions... But if they say no, you get points for it anyway :) )

No matter what they ask you, they're basically asking: 'Can you code'

Getting a technical answer is only a third of the equation.


Interviews are a competition. You don't want to be arrogant, but too much humility will cost you the job.

This is the attribute to embrace as much as possible.
Here are some opportunities to keep learning.

Technical Aptitude is only 1/3rd 

Culture and Communication are important too.

People have been hired partially based on personality


Utah Junior Developer Salary: 
/////////////
Basic, but still need some work: 40K
Mastered competencies: close to 50K

Senior Developer: 90 - 120K


------------------------------

Portfolio - It's powerful to be able to say: "I made this".

Make sure the pieces are polished, solid, and bug-free.



*Can you give me a code challenge, to take a week and send you what I have?


Not what I am, but what I want to become for that company.

"I'm not pretending, I want to learn as much as I can."

Handle critique well.


Portfolio and conversations are how I will stand out.
Fight for a conversation.


3 C's:
--------------------
1. Code 
2. Culture 
3. Communication 

Knowing your audience is important.

Try to connect with your audience. Don't try and explain super-detailed technics to an HR representitive. Give good higher level concepts, in a way that's easy to understand.

Dress Code:
--------------------
Nice Pants, and Polo (or button up plaid) 
No tie.


Interview Types?
--------------------
1. HR Interview -
Hiring manager, etc. No coding questions, necessarily.
"You can hire me, I'm safe..."

2. Technical Screen - 
Databases, servers, React Components, 

3. In-Depth Technical Interview - 
White boarding, etc.


Be careful with QA Positions (Quality Assurance great way to get into the industry... You will still be learning code. You'll spend a lot of time testing and learning from those tests.)
If you start there, keep building your portfolio regularly.

QA transitioning to Dev is one of the most common paths.

Golden Nugget Situation - What things did you not think about. Did you ever imagine someone accidentally using an * with their name?
String multiplied by String? Things break.


"How much do you think you should be making?"

"You know what, I really want to break into the industry and learn a lot."
If they push, "I would be looking for 40 - 55K..." Family situation... (based on my bills, do I have to pay for insurance, etc)

With onne of your first two jobs, you'll need at least 18 months to two years.

Your raise will not be about how long you've been at a company. It'll be about your skill. You better grow.

Internships and Contracts are viewed as growth opportunities (short-term).
