Shows all the requests the browser is making, and the order in which everything is loadking.

Connecting the Front End to the Back End is usually the hardest part. Network Tab can help with that.

Disabling the cache can make it easier to see updates and changes.


Audits Tab:
Will run tests on your website to see the flow, and offer opportunities for things to fix.

BUT don't focus on this as much at the start. Write your code, get it together first. Improve later.

Console Logs:
Makes it easy to jump into your debug tools.
If you click on the link in the console, it will take you to the part of your code that's firing. Then, you can set break points.
Break Points let you stop at a certain point in your code to help you review or fix your code, etc.

Down Arrow button will actually run the function call.

Mouse over anythingin the local scope and see what the data looks like.

list of all your variables.
